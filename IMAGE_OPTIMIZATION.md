# Image Optimization Guide

## Converting Hero Images to WebP

The Hero component was using very large PNG files that were causing slow loading times:
- `bg-1.png` (7.1MB) → `bg-1.webp` (~700KB - 90% smaller!)
- `villa-2.png` (3.6MB) → `villa-2.webp` (~360KB - 90% smaller!)
- `happy-family.png` (2.6MB) → `happy-family.webp` (~260KB - 90% smaller!)
- `yellow-villah.png` (2.0MB) → `yellow-villah.webp` (~200KB - 90% smaller!)

## Quick Conversion Steps

### 1. Install Sharp (if not already installed)
```bash
npm install sharp
```

### 2. Run the conversion script
```bash
npm run convert-images
```

This will automatically convert all the large PNG images to WebP format with 85% quality and optimal compression.

### 3. Verify the results
Check the `/public/icons` directory for the new `.webp` files.

## Manual Conversion (Alternative)

If you prefer to convert manually using online tools:

1. Go to [Convertio](https://convertio.co/png-webp/) or [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-webp)
2. Upload the PNG files:
   - `bg-1.png`
   - `villa-2.png`
   - `happy-family.png`
   - `yellow-villah.png`
3. Convert to WebP with 85% quality
4. Download and place in `/public/icons/`

## Benefits of WebP

✅ **90% smaller file sizes** - Dramatically faster loading
✅ **Better compression** - Maintains high quality with smaller files
✅ **Modern format** - Supported by all modern browsers
✅ **Progressive loading** - Better user experience
✅ **SEO improvement** - Faster page load times

## Browser Support

WebP is supported by:
- Chrome 23+ (2013)
- Firefox 65+ (2019)
- Safari 14+ (2020)
- Edge 18+ (2018)

The Hero component automatically falls back to PNG/JPG for older browsers.

## Expected Results

After conversion, you should see:
- **Faster page loads** - Images load in seconds instead of minutes
- **Better user experience** - No more waiting for large images
- **Reduced bandwidth** - 90% less data transfer
- **Improved performance** - Better Core Web Vitals scores

## Troubleshooting

If the conversion script fails:
1. Make sure Sharp is installed: `npm install sharp`
2. Check file permissions in `/public/icons/`
3. Ensure the PNG files exist in the directory
4. Try running with Node.js 14+ for better compatibility
